      "value": "<p>Before making an attack roll with a melee weapon (including weapons with the thrown property) during your turn, you can take a â€“5 penalty on the attack roll to gain a +10 bonus to damage if the attack hits. You cannot use Power Attack if the attack was made as part of a bonus action, with a thrown explosive, or when using Reckless Attack. You also cannot use Power Attack with any attack that does not require an attack roll.</p>",
